    A `Battery` entity represent a phisical battery which belongs to IoT device or
    any other electrical device with energy consumption. The entity is dependent to
    another instance which belongs. The battery has diferents attributtes whether
    if is for DC power or AC. It entity can be useful for several verticals.
